üîç Guidelines for OpenHermes

1. Extract & categorize entities:

Types: Persons, Organizations, Emails, Phone Numbers, Tools, Activities.
Context: Provide context from the text as evidence.
Confidence: Measure confidence level for each entity. 2. Relationships:

Form clear relationships (e.g., PERSON-to-ORGANIZATION, PERSON-to-PHONE, EMAIL-to-ORGANIZATION, etc.).
Use relationship types such as "INVESTIGATED_BY", "TARGETED_BY", "CONTACTED", "REPORTED_TO", "ASSOCIATED_WITH", etc.
Provide evidence (quotes from the text) for relationships. 3. Anomalies:

Highlight anomalies (like burner phones) and their potential impact.
Link anomalies to related entities and categorize severity (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). 4. Graph Data:

Nodes: Each entity is a node with a unique ID, type, and value.
Edges: Each relationship is an edge, showing source, target, type, and strength. 5. Case Information:

Include case details (case number, title, date, etc.).

analyse this data and give responce as the same previous array json structure above containing the entities, relationships, anomalies, graph with nodes and edges, case info as per the structure not missing any most importantly the graph nodes and edges that are very important in the end result which is the inference from the entities,relations and anomalies:

"A major drug trafficking ring operating out of suburban warehouses was dismantled in an early morning raid by DEA agents. The raid led to the seizure of narcotics worth over $10 million. Key players, identified as Carlos Ramirez (+1-555-222-3333) and Elena Torres (+1-555-444-5555), were arrested after weeks of surveillance. Surveillance revealed the use of coded SMS messages and brief phone calls to numbers like +1-555-888-9999 and +1-555-666-7777 to coordinate shipments. Neighbors expressed mixed emotions. Kelly Johnson, a mother of two, said, "I can‚Äôt believe this was happening so close to home. I‚Äôm relieved, but it‚Äôs terrifying to think my kids were so close to danger." Another resident, Paul Simmons, was angry: "These criminals don‚Äôt care about the lives they ruin. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre off the streets."DEA spokesperson Agent Rebecca Cruz stated, "This operation sends a strong message. We will not tolerate such activities endangering our communities." Citizens are urged to report suspicious activities to the DEA tip line at +1-800-DRUGSTOP or via email at dea.tips@agency.gov."
